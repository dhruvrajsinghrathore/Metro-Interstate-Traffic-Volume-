1. Here we have Built a traffic congestion model using scikit-learn, with feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and time-series analysis.
2. Applied Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, Linear, and Polynomial Regression with cross-validation.
3. Used pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis; tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
4â€¢ Evaluated with RMSE and R-squared; Polynomial Regression showed the best accuracy.
