# Traffic Congestion Prediction Model

## Model Development
- Built a traffic congestion model using scikit-learn
- Implemented feature scaling and one-hot encoding
- Applied time-series analysis techniques

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Multilinear Regression
- Linear Regression with Lasso and Ridge Regularisation
- Polynomial Regression
- Polynomial Regression Lasso and Ridge Regularisation 

## Tools and Techniques
- Used pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Implemented cross-validation to prevent overfitting
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

## Evaluation
- Assessed model performance using RMSE and R-squared metrics
- Polynomial Regression demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy
